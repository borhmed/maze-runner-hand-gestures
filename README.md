# Maze Runner Game Controlled by Hand Gestures

This project is a maze game where you control the movement of the player using hand gestures detected via a camera. The game is built using Python, Tkinter for the graphical user interface, and MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition. It also integrates speech recognition for voice commands to interact with the game.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Control**: Move the player through the maze using hand gestures (e.g., swipe gestures); depending on the number of fingers in one hand.
- **Maze Generation**: A dynamic maze layout with walls and paths.
- **Smooth Interaction**: The game is designed to run smoothly with real-time hand gesture and voice recognition; modifiable frame_delay .

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe


You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
